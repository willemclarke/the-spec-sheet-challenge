### The Spec Sheet Challenge

Steps to run:
`yarn install` followed by `yarn dev`

Criteria:

- meets user stories 1-6, and partially meets:
  - 8 (created files and folders saved over refresh, but not path)
  - 9 (has navigation via the back button, but not breadcrumbs)

Stack:

- typescript
- react
- lodash (convenient fns)
- chakra-UI
- localstorage via react-use hook

Opted for chakra-ui over material ui as I'm more familiar with it and felt I could work faster. Although I have used material ui before.
